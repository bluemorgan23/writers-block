Then the amended input would be displayed to the user. However, after giving this some thought, I believe that automatically making a user’s writing way more complex might not be as useful for the casual user. Also, I feel like the application would lose the educational benefit of expanding the user’s vocabulary without the ability to select from a list of synonyms. Therefore, I’ve decided to provide my own ranking system that will be displayed to the user, and if he/she wants they can attempt to climb up the ladder of scoring groups listed below.",
